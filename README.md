# POKER-DATA-EXTRACTION

There is three extraction algorithms : one for extracting the MLP inputs, one for extracting the RNN + Transformer inputs and one for extracting the Transformer inputs.

## The dataset
dataset : only the biggest file is used,
There is 42.688 hands.

## The MLP extraction
file : extraction - MLP.py

## The RNN+Transformer extraction
file : extraction-RNN+transformer.py

## The Transformer extraction
file : extraction - transformer - IlxxxlI.py
